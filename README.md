# Web_application_for_the_assignment_of_bachelor-s_projects
The purpose of this web application is to make the method of assigning students to bachelor's tutors as easy as possible. Thus, we used a database to save both the data entered by the teaching staff, but also the applications that will be made by the students in view of the bachelor's guide and the project they want to realize.
